EVTTITLE_ATTILA_001;The Birth of Normandy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATTILA_001;Traditionally known as Armorica, the northwest corner of Gaul is now increasingly dominated and settled by Norsemen and their followers. This had led to 'Armorica' slipping from common talk about the region, being replaced with 'Normannia'- Normandy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATTILA_001;Long live Normandy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_ATTILA_002;The Birth of Brittany;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATTILA_002;For centuries, there have been minor colonies of Britons along the northern coast of Gaul. Sometimes refugees, sometimes adventurers, all of them have nonetheless left their mark on the land. Although the region they settled was normally called the Saxon Shore in Roman Times, and more recently known simply as Rotomagus, after its most major city, the region is now being called Brittany, after all the Britons who now live there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATTILA_002;And now, leave Brittany alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

establish_arian_supremacy_desc;For too long, the Arian faith has been disunited and lacking in leadership. Normally no one would accept a single figure as head of the faith, but if we could establish an Arian see in Rome, the priest who rules there would be respected and heeded by the general Arian clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
